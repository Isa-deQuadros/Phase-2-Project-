        "second": "Its very interactive and if you love a good story-line and narration this is the game for you. It does at times require very specific key-stroke sequences which can take several tries (ie. hours) to figure out, but itâ€™s definitely worth it. Awesome music means you don't notice the time fly by.",
        "third": "It's a fun game, but the narrating parts are a little long so thats not awesome."
